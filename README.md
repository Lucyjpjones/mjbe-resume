# &rarr; **User Experience (UX)**

### **Purpose**

This online resume was built for a client to present their current qualifications and experience to future employers.
### **Design**

**Structure**

- A simple single page design structure with a header navbar and full screen view navigation menu to access each page section. 

**Colour scheme**
- A simple colour scheme to keep the design looking clean and elegant.
- A pale background used throughout the site to avoid any visual obstacles and helping add visual emphasis to other important parts of the design. It is also easier on the eye than a classic white.

**Typography**
- 'Roboto Mono' has been used as the main font throughout the website with Monospace as the fallback font if for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. It is a classic typewriter typeface used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

### **User stories**

The <u>key priorities</u> for my user are as follows:

1. To be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find the desired content

2. Ability to access a hard copy of CV

3. Present Qualifications and Experience

4. Ability to easily get in contact by email

5. Access links to external social accounts
